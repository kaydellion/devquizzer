            <p>Femi is currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, where his research focuses on <em>Developing an Adaptive Game-Based Learning System</em>. He noticed that some learners grasp coding better through hands-on practice, while others benefit from theory-first approaches.</p>
            <p>DevQuizzer was created to bridge this gap by leveraging AI, gamification, and real-time assessment to personalize coding education.</p>
